This solution involves using `react-native-fs` to access and handle the local file path. This library ensures that we work directly with the filesystem's paths, avoiding potential URI encoding issues:

```javascript
import { Image } from 'expo-image';
import RNFS from 'react-native-fs';

const imagePath = '/path/to/my image.jpg'; //Note the space

RNFS.readFile(imagePath, 'base64').then(base64Data => {
  const imageUri = `data:image/jpg;base64,${base64Data}`; // Create a data URI from base64

  //Now the Image component will work correctly:
  <Image source={{ uri: imageUri }} style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }} />
});
```

Alternatively, if using a library that gives a different path you would change this to the correct path that library gives you.  The key is to prevent URI encoding issues by handling the path at a lower level, then use a `data` URI to make it available to the `Image` component.
